> I believe there's a lot of value in PHPStan, it saves time and money twice — you don't have to write tests for every line of code to verify that your application works, and it prevents critical bugs reaching production so you're not losing money because your customers can't buy the thing they want.
> People who are already using it can't imagine their PHP projects without it anymore. And their ranks grow every day. To make sure PHPStan is here to stay and is being continuously and consistently improved, it needs funding. That's why I came up with the idea of release sponsorship. We piloted it last November with Roave and it was awesome.
