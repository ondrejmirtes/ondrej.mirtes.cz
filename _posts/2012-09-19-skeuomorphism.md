> What’s skeuomorphism? If you’ve ever used an Apple product, you’ve experienced [digital skeuomorphic design](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669879/can-we-please-move-past-apples-silly-faux-real-uis): calendars with faux leather-stitching, bookshelves with wood veneers, fake glass and paper and brushed chrome. Skeuomorphism is a catch-all term for when objects retain ornamental elements of past, derivative iterations--elements that are no longer necessary to the current objects’ functions.
